# ♟ ChessBot

**ChessBot** is a project I built for my general engineering design course. It’s a smart chessboard system that combines Python, C++, and hardware like motors, an electromagnet, and LEDs to create an interactive chess experience. The board can move pieces automatically, respond to voice commands, and manage game timing — it was definitely one of the most challenging and rewarding projects I’ve worked on so far!
## 🌟 Features

- **⏱ Chess clock and timer:** Uses threading and parallel processing to keep accurate game time without lag.
- **📋 Move logging:** Automatically generates PGN files so you can review or analyze your games later.
- **📟 LCD display integration:** Displays player timers, moves, or messages on an I2C LCD screen.
- **⚡ Threading & parallel processing:** Keeps the system responsive while handling different tasks at once.
- **🗣 Voice command control:** Uses Google Cloud’s Speech-to-Text API so players can move pieces using voice commands.
- **♻️ Automated piece movement:** Includes a linear motion system with an electromagnet that moves pieces across the board.
- **🏅 Award-winning project:** I was awarded with an annual distinction for excellence in engineering design for this project!
